# Feature Specification: Google Gemini Image Generation

**Feature Branch**: `002-google-api-key`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "幫我整合 google 的 api key, 並且我要在首頁做一個可以輸入 prompt 並且利用 AI SDK 呼叫 Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image 的功能，在使用者輸入命令之後生成圖片顯示在畫面上，並且整個設計要能夠 responsive。"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to enter a text description on the homepage and see an AI-generated image based on my description, on any device.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the homepage, **When** I enter "a cat sitting on a roof" into the prompt field and click "Generate", **Then** I see an image that matches the description.
2. **Given** I am on a mobile device, **When** I generate an image, **Then** the layout of the input field and the displayed image is properly adjusted to my screen size.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user submits an empty prompt?
- What happens if the image generation fails?
- What happens if the user enters a very long prompt?
- What happens if the generated content is inappropriate?
- The system will not implement content moderation at this time.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: How should the system handle potentially inappropriate user prompts or generated images? → A: Do not implement content moderation at this time.
- Q: How will the Google API key be provided and stored? → A: As a plain text environment variable.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide an input field on the homepage for users to enter a text prompt.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST have a button to trigger the image generation process.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST generate an image based on the user's text prompt.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST display the generated image on the homepage.
- **FR-005**: The user interface MUST be responsive and adapt to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **FR-006**: The system MUST handle errors during the image generation process and inform the user.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST securely store and use a Google API key, which will be provided as a plain text environment variable.
- **FR-008**: The system will not have a policy for handling potentially inappropriate user prompts or generated images at this time.
