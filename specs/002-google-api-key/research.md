# Research: Google Gemini Image Generation

## Performance Goals

- **Decision**: p95 latency for image generation should be under 5 seconds.
- **Rationale**: For a good user experience, the image should be generated relatively quickly. 5 seconds is a reasonable starting point for a prototype.
- **Alternatives considered**: Stricter latency goals (e.g., <2s) were considered but deemed too aggressive for an initial prototype without further performance tuning.

## Constraints

- **Decision**: The application will only support modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with JavaScript enabled.
- **Rationale**: This is a standard constraint for modern web applications and simplifies development.
- **Alternatives considered**: Supporting older browsers would add significant complexity and is not necessary for this feature.

## Scale/Scope

- **Decision**: The feature will be designed for a single user at a time. No multi-user or concurrent request handling will be implemented in the initial version.
- **Rationale**: This simplifies the initial implementation and is sufficient for a prototype.
- **Alternatives considered**: Building a multi-user system would require additional complexity around user management and request queuing, which is out of scope for the initial feature.
