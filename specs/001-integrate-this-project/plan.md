# Implementation Plan: Integrate with latest Vercel AI SDK

**Branch**: `001-integrate-this-project` | **Date**: 2025-09-26 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-integrate-this-project/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
   → Verify PNPM usage requirement (Principle I)
   → Confirm CLI script availability (Principle II)
   → Check Next.js framework adherence (Principle III)
   → Validate modern JavaScript standards (Principle IV)
   → Ensure component-driven UI approach (Principle V)
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This plan outlines the steps to integrate the latest Vercel AI SDK into the project. The primary requirement is to install the `ai` package using `pnpm` and verify the installation.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, Vercel AI SDK
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Jest, Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Vercel
**Project Type**: Web
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: N/A
**Scale/Scope**: N/A

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Principle I: PNPM Package Management**: PASS
- **Principle II: CLI-First Development**: PASS
- **Principle III: Next.js Framework Adherence**: PASS
- **Principle IV: Modern JavaScript Standards**: PASS
- **Principle V: Component-Driven UI Development**: PASS

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - None.

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - Task: "Research Vercel AI SDK for Next.js integration"

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: Use `pnpm` to install the `ai` package.
   - Rationale: As per user request and constitution.
   - Alternatives considered: None.

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - No new entities.

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - No new APIs.

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - No new contract tests.

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Quickstart test created.

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh gemini`

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 5-10 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
|           |            |                                     |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
