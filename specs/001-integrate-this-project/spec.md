# Feature Specification: Integrate with latest Vercel AI SDK

**Feature Branch**: `001-integrate-this-project`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "integrate this project with latest vercel AI SDK. use context7 to figure out how to intall and intall for me."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: How should the system behave if the Vercel AI SDK installation fails due to a package manager conflict? ‚Üí A: Abort the installation and report the conflict.
- Q: Should the integration be pinned to a specific major version of the Vercel AI SDK to prevent breaking changes? ‚Üí A: No, always use the absolute latest version.
- Q: What is the expected behavior if the installation fails due to network issues? ‚Üí A: Retry the installation automatically up to 3 times.
- Q: Are there any specific observability requirements, like logging the installation process? ‚Üí A: No, no specific logging is required.
- Q: Should anything be explicitly declared as out-of-scope for this feature? ‚Üí A: No, nothing is explicitly out-of-scope.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to integrate the latest Vercel AI SDK into the project to leverage its features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the project does not have the Vercel AI SDK installed, **When** the installation process is run, **Then** the latest Vercel AI SDK is added to the project's dependencies.
2. **Given** the Vercel AI SDK is installed, **When** I check the project's dependencies, **Then** the Vercel AI SDK is listed with the latest version.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the installation fails due to network issues? ‚Üí Retry the installation automatically up to 3 times.
- How does the system handle package manager conflicts? ‚Üí Abort the installation and report the conflict.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST use context7 to find the installation instructions for the latest Vercel AI SDK.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST install the absolute latest version of the Vercel AI SDK.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST verify that the Vercel AI SDK is correctly installed.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: No specific logging is required for the installation process.

### Out of Scope
- Nothing is explicitly out-of-scope for this feature.
